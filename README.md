# CS255SystemAnalysisandDesign

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

> The client was DriverPass and they wanted to provide better driver training with online courses and in-person instruction.

**What did you do particularly well?**

> The thing that I think I did particularly well was creating the class diagrams and following the data flow.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

> The one part I would like to revise is my sequences diagram, I think that I could have made it more clear on how everything works in the sequence.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

> From the start of the system design I wanted to consider the user's needs. I tryed to make my diagrams based on the user's needs because without the user's needs the system design could end up not producing any solutions to the problems that they wanted solved.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

> At the start of this course I would approach software design with the mindset of "I have to get every detail from the start", but now i try to use the technique of iterative design. By doing this I can make several passes over the project and find new data everytime I loop through. I do this now with the intention of finding any information that I may have missed the first time reading the data.
